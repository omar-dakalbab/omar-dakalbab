ðŸš€ Software Engineer | 4+ Years of Experience

With four years of experience in software engineering, I specialize in developing scalable, high-performance web and mobile applications. As both a frontend and backend developer, I cover the entire development stackâ€”from user interfaces to backend logic and database managementâ€”ensuring seamless, optimized, and user-centric digital experiences.
My expertise spans the full development lifecycleâ€”design, development, deployment, and performance optimizationâ€”using a diverse tech stack, including React.js, Next.js, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, and PHP. Iâ€™ve successfully delivered multiple freelancing projects, focusing on clean code, scalability, and intuitive UX/UI to transform ideas into impactful solutions.
